# VGG16 Transfer Learning for Classification of Brain Tumors

This repository contains code that demonstrates how to perform image classification using transfer learning with the VGG16 model for the diagnosis of tumors in the brain. The VGG16 model is pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset, and we will fine-tune it to solve a custom binary classification task using your own dataset.

## Introduction

Transfer learning is a powerful technique in deep learning, where a pre-trained model is used as a starting point for a new task. By leveraging the knowledge already captured by the pre-trained model, we can train a new model for our specific task with fewer data and computational resources. VGG16 is a popular deep convolutional neural network architecture known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image recognition tasks.

## Requirements

Before running the code, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib


## Dataset

To train and validate the model, you need to prepare your dataset. Organize the dataset in the following structure:

- data/
    - class1/
      image1.jpg
      image2.jpg
      ...
    - class2/
      image1.jpg
      image2.jpg
      ...


In the above structure, `data/` is the main data folder, and each subfolder (e.g., `class1/`, `class2/`) represents a class, containing images belonging to their respective classes.

## Understanding the Code

### Importing Libraries

The first step in the code is to import the required libraries. We import `pandas` and `numpy` for data manipulation, `tensorflow` and `keras` for deep learning, and `matplotlib` for visualizations.

### Loading and Configuring the VGG16 Model

Next, we load the VGG16 model pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. We exclude the top classification layer of the VGG16 model, as we will add our custom classification head for our binary classification task.

### Building the Custom Classification Head

We build a custom classification head on top of the VGG16 base model. The custom head consists of fully connected (dense) layers with ReLU activation functions. The last layer is a softmax activation layer with 2 units for binary classification (two classes).

### Freezing VGG16 Layers

To leverage the pre-trained weights without destroying the valuable information, we set the layers of the VGG16 model as non-trainable. This step freezes the weights of the pre-trained model, and only the weights of the custom classification head will be updated during training.

### Data Augmentation and Preprocessing

We use the `ImageDataGenerator` from Keras to perform data augmentation and preprocessing. Data augmentation helps to artificially increase the size of the dataset, reducing the risk of overfitting. Preprocessing involves rescaling pixel values and other transformations to prepare the data for the VGG16 model.

### Compiling the Model

Before training the model, we need to compile it. We use the Adam optimizer, which is a popular optimization algorithm, and categorical cross-entropy as the loss function for our binary classification task. The metric we monitor is accuracy, which tells us how well the model is performing.

### Data Generators

We create two data generators, one for the training set and the other for the validation set. The data generators will generate batches of data during training and validation. The training set is used to update the model's weights, while the validation set is used to evaluate the model's performance without updating the weights.

### Training the Model

Finally, we train the model using the `fit_generator` function. We specify the number of epochs and the batch size. During training, the model will be saved after each epoch if the validation loss improves using the `ModelCheckpoint` callback.

## Fine-Tuning

By default, the code freezes the pre-trained VGG16 layers and only trains the custom classification head. If you want to perform fine-tuning of the VGG16 layers as well, you can modify the script accordingly. Fine-tuning requires more data and careful selection of learning rates.

## Note

It is essential to have sufficient GPU resources for training, as VGG16 is a relatively large model. If you face memory issues, consider reducing the batch size or using a smaller image size.
